## üß© Templates

Templates define the fake page served to the target. You can use built-in templates or add your own.

### Using Built-in Templates

- `gmail`: Gmail login interface
- `instagram`: Instagram login interface

### Adding Custom Templates

1. Place your HTML file inside the `/static/templates` directory.
2. Add a new entry to the `templateMap` in `main.go`:
   ```go
   var templateMap = map[string]string{
       "instagram": "instagram.html",
       "gmail":     "gmail.html",
       "yourname":  "yourfile.html",
   }
   ```
3. Run the tool with `-template yourname`

## üì¶ Output & Logging

All captured data is stored under the `data/` directory. Each target session creates its own folder which may include:

- Screenshots
- Audio files
- Webcam captures
- Clipboard dumps
- Keylogger logs and more

---

## üåê Deployment & Hook.js

Falsecho runs **only over HTTPS** (port `443` by default).

Although the Go-based backend can be compiled (`go build`), the tool heavily depends on the static files‚Äîespecially `hook.js`. This file contains the client-side logic that gathers data and interacts with the browser.

You can also deploy `hook.js` independently by injecting it into any external site you control.
